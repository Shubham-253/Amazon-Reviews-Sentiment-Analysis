# Amazon-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis
An end to end project (that I didn't find any easy solution of) for extracting Amazon reviews that does what it claims(without giving error until Amazon decides to change structure of their webpages). What makes it unique is the power of selenium and Streamlit come together to create a complete tool. I hope you love it and you will !!

# To run the app locally
<clipboard-copy><pre>
python -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
</pre></clipboard-copy>

where, venv is basically virtual env , you can name it anything mine was "Democracy"
